                    The Siamese cat is one of the first distinctly recognised breeds of Asian cat. It derives from the Wichianmat landrace. 
                    The Siamese cat is one of several varieties of cats native to Thailand (known as Siam before 1939). 
                    The original Siamese became one of the most popular breeds in Europe and North America in the 19th century. 
                    Siamese cats have a distinctive colourpoint coat, resulting from a temperature-sensitive type of albinism.

                    The British Shorthair is the pedigreed version of the traditional British domestic cat, with a distinctively stocky body, thick coat, and broad face. 
                    The most familiar colour variant is the "British Blue", with a solid grey-blue coat, pineapple eyes, and a medium-sized tail. 
                    The breed has also been developed in a wide range of other colours and patterns, including tabby and colourpoint.

                    The Maine Coon is a large domesticated cat breed. One of the oldest natural breeds in North America, the breed originated in the U.S. state of Maine, where it is the official state cat.

                    The Maine Coon is a large and social cat, commonly referred to as "the gentle giant." 
                    The Maine Coon is predominantly known for its size and dense coat of fur which helps it survive in the harsh climate of Maine. 
                    The Maine Coon is often cited as having "dog-like" characteristics.

                    The Persian cat, also known as the Persian Longhair, is a long-haired breed of catcharacterised by a round face and short muzzle. 
                    The first documented ancestors of Persian cats might have been imported into Italy from Khorasan as early as around 1620, however, this has not been proven. 
                    Instead, there is stronger evidence for a longhaired cat breed being exported from Iran from the 19th century onwards. 
                    Persian cats have been widely recognised by the North-West European cat fancy since the 19th century, and after World War II by breeders from North America, Australia and New Zealand. 
                    Some cat fancier organisations' breed standards subsume the Himalayan and Exotic Shorthair as variants of this breed, while others generally treat them as separate breeds.

                    The Ragdoll is a breed of cat with a distinct colorpoint coat and blue eyes. Its morphology is large and weighty, and it has a semi-long and silky soft coat. 
                    American breeder Ann Baker developed Ragdolls in the 1960s. They are best known for their docile, placid temperament and affectionate nature. 
                    The name Ragdoll is derived from the tendency of individuals from the original breeding stock to go limp and relaxed when picked up. 
                    The breed is particularly popular in both the United Kingdom and the United States.

                    Ragdolls are often known as "dog-like cats" or "puppy-like cats", due to their tendency to follow people around, their receptiveness to handling, and their relative lack of aggression towards other pets.
