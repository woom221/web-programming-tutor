# Web Programming Tutor

I recently launched a group tutoring program for web programming, starting on November 2, 2024. Drawing on the curriculum from the University of Toronto's web programming course (CSC309), I tailor and adapt content to suit the specific needs and learning goals of my students. The students are complete beginners with no prior experience in computer programming.

The sessions aim to equip students with the skills and confidence to independently build their own websites, covering key technologies including HTML/CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, and Django.
