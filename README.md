# Web Programming Tutor

I recently launched a group tutoring program for web programming, starting on November 2, 2024. Drawing on the curriculum from the University of Toronto's web programming course (CSC309), I tailor and adapt content to suit the specific needs and learning goals of my students. The students are complete beginners with no prior experience in computer programming.

Although I am a recent graduate, I am eager to deepen my knowledge of web programming by teaching these materials, believing that the process of teaching will further enhance my understanding.

The sessions aim to equip students with the skills and confidence to independently build their own websites, covering key technologies including HTML/CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, and Django.

## HTML Demonstration

After a brief overview of HTML, an example HTML document was created to serve as a quick reference before the Assignment 1 deadline, which required students to build their first website using pure HTML. To further support their understanding, a demonstration video was also provided.
